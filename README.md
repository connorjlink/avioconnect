# HOPAS
A play on HOTAS—"hands-on-phone-and-stick". Okay, maybe the acronym is terrible, but honestly the app works pretty well. It effortlessly synchronizes an iOS-device–equipped IMU readouts to control X-Plane 12 aircraft natively. It features smooth roll, pitch, togglable yaw control, and an optional throttle control feature.

## Planned Features
- Improved UI layout and better compatibility with iPad devices
- ~~More aircraft controls, including autopilot and brakes toggles~~
- Some kind of head tracking implementation?

## Known Issues
None currently
