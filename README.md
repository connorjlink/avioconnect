A play on HOTAS—"hands-on-phone-and-stick". Okay, maybe the acronym is terrible, but honestly the app works pretty well. It effortlessly synchronizes an iOS-device–equipped IMU readouts to control X-Plane 12 aircraft natively. It features smooth roll, pitch, and togglable yaw control, with an optional throttle control feature, too.
